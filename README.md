# FTP UPLOAD

**Upload to one site or multiple sites.**

EXAMPLE:
public_html/
    sites/
        site1
        site2
        site3

All the files selected will be uploaded to all children in /sites.

It is important that the local folder in the GUI matches the dir-tree/structure
on the server. This because the files being uploaded will use the same path,
except being cropped to match public_html ofcourse.
