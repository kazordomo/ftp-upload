# FTP UPLOAD

**Purpose of being able to upload to one or multiple sites.**

EXAMPLE:
public_html/
    sites/
        site1
        site2
        site3

All the files selected will be uploaded to all children in /sites.

The local files will be sent to the server and use the same path as it does
localy. Meaning that folder1/folder2/file1 will be put in folder1/folder2/
as file1, on the server.
